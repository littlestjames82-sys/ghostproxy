"""Fail-open battery (PLAN.md Verification bar).

Design rule under test: if the proxy errors, times out, or cannot
parse a request, the ORIGINAL request goes through untouched and the
failure is logged. A context tool must never be the reason an agent
run dies. All traffic here goes to a fake upstream on 127.0.0.1.
